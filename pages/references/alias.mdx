# Adding an alias

Typically, the command of `tablespoon` is too long and inconvenient to type out each time, to fix this you can have a custom alias.

After installing the cli a new PATH env should be added to your rc file for your specific shell environment, below this line the following should be added:

```
...

export PATH="$PATH:/Users/name/.local/bin" # < -- auto-generated

# default alias is "tbsp"
eval $(tablespoon alias --disable-update-checks) # < -- this line
```
however, this should be added according to your shell env

## Custom alias

For a custom alias you can use the flag `--shorthand` to pass in the new alias you want to use for the program.

```
...

export PATH=="$PATH:/Users/name/.local/bin" # < -- auto-generated

# alias will be "coffee"
eval $(tablespoon alias --shorthand=coffee --disable-update-checks) # < -- this line
```
