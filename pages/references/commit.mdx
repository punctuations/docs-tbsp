# Creating Commits
The commit command generates a commit message, then commits it.

This command has five possible flags to use:
- `--full` (`-f`): full length commit description, showing all files changed.
- `--unstaged` (`-u`): generate a commit message for unstaged files, then commit it.
- `--no-comment` (`-n`): prompts the user for a short description instead of using comments.
- `--select` (`-s`): allows user to choose the file to showcase in the short commit message.
- `--co-author` (`-c`): adds a co-author to the commit.

## Full commit message
`tablespoon commit --full`
