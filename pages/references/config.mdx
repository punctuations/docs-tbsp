# Configurations

As it goes for configurations for tablespoon there are two different usages.

## Config file
The config file contains customization options for tablespoon, the file can be named either "`tablespoon.json`", or "`tbsp.json`".

Example config file:
```json
{
  "commentID": "!#: ",
  "extend": {
    "types": ["cleanup"]
  },
  "cleanup": false,
  "confirmationPrompt": true,
  "ignored": ["whiteboard.md"]
}
```

- `commentID`: The comment ID is the ID used to differentiate a normal comment and a tbsp comment.
- `extend.types`: extend.types is used to extend the possible types you can use in tablespoon.
- `cleanup`: Cleanup is a setting which will delete tbsp comments after it is detected through tablespoon.
- `confirmationPrompt`: Prompt confirmation is used for the confirmation prompt that appears when the commit command is run.
- `ignored`: Ignored setting is for files that aren't ignored by the `.gitignore` file but shouldn't be included in tablespoon, like a TODO file.

## Config command

The config command will print out the config file once it is located, used for debugging purposes.
